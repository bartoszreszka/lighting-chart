A Java program that calculates times and generates "lighting chart" for following phenomenons in a given month:
- sunrise (top edge of the sun appears on the horizon);
- sunset (sun disappears below the horizon);
- moonrise (top edge of the moon appears on the horizon);
- moonset (moon disappears below the horizon);
- and moon phase.

## Features

- Requires Java 8 or higher;
- depends on [commons-suncalc](https://github.com/shred/commons-suncalc) library.

## Accuracy

The results have an accuracy of about a minute and are not sufficient for astronomical purposes.
